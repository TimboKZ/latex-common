%-- example usage start
This template is meant to be used for problem set solutions. It has features
similar to that of the \code{lecture-notes} template - check it out for the
preview of what is possible.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define the {\em triangle-rank} of a Boolean matrix to be the
      sidelength of the largest square submatrix (possibly after permuting
      the rows and columns) with ones on the diagonal
      and zeros below the diagonal. Notice that triangle-rank is at
      most the standard rank.  
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider a matrix $M$ with rows and columns indexed by sets $X$
          and $Y$. For subsets $S \subset X$ and $T \subset Y$, denote by
          $M_1$ the submatrix of $M$ restricted to rows indexed by $S$ and
          denote by $M_2$ the submatrix of $M$ restricted to columns indexed
          by $T$. Show that \[\mbox{triangle-rank}(M_1) +
          \mbox{triangle-rank}(M_2) \le \mbox{triangle-rank}(M).\]
        \item Let $M_f$ be the matrix associated with function $f:X \times Y
          \rightarrow \{0,1\}$. Prove that 
        \[D(M_f) \le (\log_2(\mbox{triangle-rank}(M_f)+1) + 1)(N^0(M_f) + 1).\]
        Hint: Induction on triangle-rank. Fix a $0$-cover. Alice should focus
        on rectangles $S \times T$ in this cover for which restricting $M$ to
        the rows indexed by $S$ reduces the triangle rank by at least a factor
        $2$; Bob should focus on rectangles $S \times T$ in this cover for
        which restricting $M$ to the columns indexed by $T$ reduces the
        triangle rank by at least a factor of $2$. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item The section above is not a solution to a problem set question, but
        rather a question taken out of a CS 153 problem set I received at
        Caltech.  Nevertheless, it has the structure that problem set solutions
        usually have, so I'm going to leave it there.
\end{enumerate}
